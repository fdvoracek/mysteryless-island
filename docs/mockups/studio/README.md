# Content Studio mockup — UX reference, not implemented

Static, self-contained HTML screens showing the intended layout and flows of the planned Content
Studio. Scope, decisions and PR order live in
[CONTENT_STUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../../CONTENT_STUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md); where this
mockup and the plan differ, the plan wins. Nothing here is Studio code.

Open any file in a browser. Links move between screens; the activity editor's Form/JSON switch and
the new-area wizard (ID validation, map-cell picker, file preview) work. Fonts load from Google
Fonts; offline the system fallbacks are used.

## Screens and the PRs that build them

| File | Screen | Built in |
|---|---|---|
| [area-workspace.html](area-workspace.html) | Area workspace for `forest`: properties, map and unlock, landmarks, linked activities, "used by", live preview panel | Shell PR-04 · live preview PR-06 · workspace PR-08 |
| [activity-editor.html](activity-editor.html) | Activity `strip_bark`: generic form, nested condition builder, yields, journal variants with the 80-character counter, pending diff, Form/JSON switch | Form PR-05 · condition builder and text widget PR-07 |
| [story-view.html](story-view.html) | Story graph: discoveries → tasks → areas/events, with the node inspector and "continue the story" actions | PR-09 |
| [event-editor.html](event-editor.html) | Event `shipwreck`: scene graph, modal vs journal text, choices with effects, graph checks | PR-09 |
| [new-area-wizard.html](new-area-wizard.html) | New area: ID validation, map cell picker, unlock condition, file preview | PR-08 |

Not drawn yet: crafting/building tree editor and map editor (PR-10), the diagnostics panel in
detail, and forms for items, recipes, buildings and tasks (these use the same generic form as the
activity editor).

## Visual language for PR-04

PR-04 turns these into Studio-wide tokens; later PRs reuse them instead of inventing new styles.
The Studio's look is a neutral tool UI, separate from the game's book style
([VISUAL_STYLE.md](../../VISUAL_STYLE.md) does not apply to it); game text previews use a serif.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Ground / panel | `#F3F4F6` / `#FFFFFF` | page background / cards and side panels |
| Border / input border | `#D9DCE1` / `#C9CDD3` | panel and input outlines |
| Ink / muted | `#16191D` / `#545C66` | text / labels and secondary text |
| Accent / accent soft | `#1F5FAD` / `#E6EEF8` | primary buttons, links, selection |
| OK / warning / error text | `#245733` / `#8A4608` / `#9A2A1F` | validation states |
| Story node fills | discovery `#F6EEDF`, task `#E6EEF8`, area `#E5F0E8`, event `#EFE9F6` | story and event graphs (each also labelled, not colour-only) |
| UI font | Inter, system-ui fallback | everything except IDs and game text |
| ID / code font | JetBrains Mono, ui-monospace fallback | IDs, file paths, JSON |
| Game text font | Source Serif 4, Georgia fallback | journal and modal text previews |

Inline styles in these files are for the mockup only; implement them as Studio components and
tokens, not by copying markup.

## Data and maintenance

Screens use real content as of 2026-10-21 (forest, `strip_bark`, `shipwreck`, landmark journal
lines, entity counts); later content edits may make those details stale without making the layout
wrong. When a UX decision changes, update the affected file here in the same PR. The Claude design
artifact "Content Studio mockup" was the working copy these files were exported from; this folder
is the reference agents use.
